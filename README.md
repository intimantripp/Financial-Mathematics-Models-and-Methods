# Financial-Mathematics-Models-and-Methods

Welcome!

The purpose of this project is twofold. On the one hand, it will be a place where I can store my workings that will help build my understanding as I familiarise myself with financial maths. On the other hand, it also serves as a place where I can hopefully share that understanding and learning with others. We all learn differently, and my hope is that my particular style of teaching and explaining might help a few people who are struggling to follow the other's teaching.
